	<p id="Open"><strong>Caution: </strong>
		No single paper can tell you without qualifications which is the best software
		development model for your organization to adopt. As with any decision involving significant complexities, the only thing one can say for sure is “it depends.”
	</p>
	<p id="Open">We will provide you with arguments <strong>for</strong> and <strong>against</strong> each class of software and outline other factors you must consider to reach a sound conclusion for your particular situation. Although many of the characteristics of open source versus proprietary software packages clearly set them far apart, they also share several features too.
	</p>
	<p  id="Open">The idea that <em>Proprietary</em> and <em>Open Source</em> solutions are polar opposites is certainly not true. Software vendors have built proprietary solutions that they have later released as open source. Similarly, there are distributors of license-free, open source packages who also offer a for-profit, licensed and proprietary version built upon the original open source platform. It might be easier to think of open source and closed source as simply distinct software development methodologies that naturally create their own contexts of interaction based on their underlying philosophies. In any case, here is plenty of food for thought upon which to make your own decision.
