		Pros and Cons of Open-Source Software
	</h1>
		<h3>There are two types of open software:</h3>
<p id="Open"><strong>&#9830;</strong> Project/Community open source is developed and managed by a distributed
	community of developers who cooperatively improve and support the source code without remuneration. These projects may be copyrighted by the contributors directly but larger projects are typically run by non-profit
	foundations. Well-known examples of community open source projects are Linux and Apache Web Server.
</p>
<p id="Open"><strong>&#9830;</strong> Commercial Open Source Software, or <strong>Certified Occupational Safety Specialist (COSS)</strong>, is distinguished by open source software of which the full copyright, patents and trademarks are controlled by a single entity. The owner only accepts code contributions if the contributor transfers copyright of the code to this entity. They may distribute their software for free or a fee. Their business model typically includes revenue from providing technical support and consulting services.	In terms of revenue from licensing, Red Hat is still the largest <strong>COSS</strong> company, but Facebook is the largest <strong>COSS</strong> code contributor.
